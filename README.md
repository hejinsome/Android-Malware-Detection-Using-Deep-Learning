Module 3 progress

The following Feature selection algorithms have been used:
1. Variance threshold(varthresh.py)
2. Select K Best(selkbest.py)
3. L1 sparse learning(l1.py)
4. Extra Tree classifier(tree.py)

The algorithms take in features stored as a dataframe(in features.csv)
and select a certain set of features. Neural network is trained on these
features and the corresponding h5 weight files are stored.
